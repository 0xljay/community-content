The journey to learning Data Analysis is as good as starting with the right resources and keeping them basic. In this article, I will help you streamline your learning journey by focusing on what matters in a timely manner.

One of the challenges beginners face in this recent time while learning Data Analysis with Power BI is abundance of information which is opten called Information Overload. There are thousands of resources and learning path out there that make beginners easily get overwhelmed.


## Start from here
If you have ever attempted learning Data Analytics or Power BI and you've not been able to have a good grasp of your learning journey, you might be missing some fundamental knowledge which is what I want to help you cover in this collection. I promise to keep them always short but productive.


## Is this all?
I am sure you are wondering if this is all that is required in your learning journey. There are lots of recommendations for beginners and I would like to state some of them here. I often recommend sometimes to start a Data Analysis journey with Applications like Excel but if you are starting from here, you are on track.


## It is not what you are thinking
Data Analytics is not what you are thinking. It is not about Excel, Power BI, Python, or any other tools outside there. Data Analytics is all about "Business Value". Once you understand this and how to meet this need, the journey becomes easier for you.


## Time to learn
I am glad you have come to understand the real thing about Data Analytics, It is never about the tools, it is first, about the business. Now it's time to get started and Learn.

## Without this, you are not done
You are not done with your learning until you do this. Remember, I want to help you translate your knowledge of Power BI to SKill and to validate this, you will need to work on a project. finish up the dataset used in the learning modules, build a report, and share it on LinkedIn and X.
